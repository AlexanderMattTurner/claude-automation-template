# Post the automated-review gate's verdict as a COMMIT STATUS on the PR head.
#
# PROBLEM CLASS — auto-merge landing a pull request before the reviewer has
# spoken. The cheap checks finish in about ninety seconds while an LLM review
# takes minutes, so a PR whose ruleset lists only the cheap checks merges first
# and the reviewer's REQUEST_CHANGES arrives on a merged PR. Nothing is red; the
# review simply was not part of the merge gate.
#
# The predicate is one line and stateless: a pull request is clear when at least
# one review of it stands undismissed. It needs no memory of which reviews have
# been seen, and it re-derives the same answer on every event.
#
# PR-SCOPED, NOT HEAD-SCOPED, and that is load-bearing. Requiring a review OF THE
# CURRENT HEAD looks stricter and strands the pull request instead:
# decide-pr-review-trigger.sh answers run=false for a plain `synchronize`, so
# once the reviewer has approved, the next push produces a head nothing will ever
# review, and a head-scoped gate would hold that pull request at `pending`
# forever with no event able to clear it. Whether a later push still satisfies
# the reviewer is a question the reviewer already owns: a non-approving verdict
# makes every push re-run the cheap recheck, and the review-required ruleset
# holds the merge meanwhile. This gate answers only the question nothing else
# did — has the reviewer spoken about this pull request at all?
#
# A COMMIT STATUS, not this job's own check run. Under `pull_request_target` the
# job's check run is reported against the BASE commit, so it never satisfies a
# requirement evaluated on the pull request's head. A status posted explicitly on
# `HEAD_SHA` does.
#
# Can't-verify is RED, never green: an API failure propagates through `set -e`,
# because a gate that fails open lets a PR merge past a review nobody read.
#
# Env: GH_TOKEN, GH_REPO (owner/name), PR, HEAD_SHA, RUN_URL.

# Every review that still stands, paginated: a long-lived PR accumulates more

# workflow's `dismissed` trigger do something — dismissing the only review
# returns the PR to `pending`.
#
# The filter is per-element (`.[] | select(…)`), never a reducer: `gh api
# --paginate --jq` applies the filter to EACH page, so a `first`/`max_by` would
# silently run once per page and answer from the last one.
#
# Any actor's review counts. The reviewer's own clears it, and so does the
# approval auto-approve-skipped posts for a PR the reviewer skips by title or
# author — reading that OUTCOME rather than re-deriving the skip predicate,
# which would be a second copy of decide-pr-review-trigger.sh's rules.
