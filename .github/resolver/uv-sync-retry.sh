# PyPI failure. Extra args pass through to `uv sync` (e.g. `--extra dev`);
# `--frozen` is always applied, because every CI leg installs the locked set.
#
# PROBLEM CLASS — a package download that stalls or drops reds a CI job that only
# wanted to install its dependencies.
#
# uv's own budget is 3 attempts against a 30 s per-request timeout, and it spends
# all 3 back to back. A registry or CDN stall longer than that exhausts the budget
# in about two minutes and fails the job. This raises the per-request timeout and
# uv's retry count, then retries the whole sync through gb_retry, so an outage of
# tens of seconds still ends in a green install.

# A SIBLING, not a path off the repo root: the project this syncs is named by
# `--project`, and it is a different repository from the one shipping this
# script. Deriving the helper from the root would look for it in the tree being
# synced, which is exactly the tree that does not have to carry the resolver.

# 30 s default is a timeout those legs hit on a healthy network.
