"""Render a markdown report of every hand-authored merge-resolution delta in a
PR's commit range, for supervision review.

A merge commit's tree is authored freely, so a conflict resolution can smuggle
in a change present in NEITHER parent (an "evil merge") that a normal
one-parent diff never shows. `git show --remerge-diff` reconstructs the
mechanical merge and diffs the recorded tree against it, isolating exactly
what the resolver typed. This runs that over every merge commit in
BASE_SHA..HEAD_SHA and prints one section per merge whose resolution differs
from the mechanical result.

Three classes of delta are annotated instead of rendered, since a provenance
read of them cannot produce a finding anyone can act on:
  - one made ENTIRELY of the parents' own edits (`hunk_traced_to_the_parents`);
  - one the HEAD has already undone, whole-file (`_superseded_paths`) or hunk
    by hunk (`hunk_undone_at_head`);
  - a GENERATOR-OWNED output (the caller's rule table, named by
    AUTO_RESOLVE_RESOLVER_MJS), whose bytes a required check re-derives from
    source on the PR head.
Lockfiles are NOT in that set.

A rendered section also carries git's own conflict notices for paths the
mechanical merge could not resolve at all (`_notice_lines`).

Env and argv:
  - BASE_SHA, HEAD_SHA — required.
  - REMERGE_REPORT_MAX_BYTES caps the body. UNSET MEANS NO CAP; only the
    PR-comment renderer sets it (GitHub truncates a comment at 65536).
  - `--commit SHA` reports that one merge instead, uncapped.
  - `--shas-out PATH` additionally writes the sha of every merge rendered, so a
    consumer can key durable state on which merges a review covered. Refuses to
    run under a cap.

Fails loud on a merge with more than two parents: --remerge-diff cannot
reconstruct an octopus merge.

`.claude/dev-notes` § "Merge-resolution delta report: annotation classes and refusals (`.github/resolver/remerge-diff-report.py`)" carries the rest.
