# kcov-exclude: a GitHub Actions step body that no test runs: it reads the runner's context
#   — GITHUB_*, a job-scoped GH_TOKEN, an actions/ working directory — or provisions the
#   runner itself, so it has no entry point off a runner.
# lib-marker-comment.sh — find the PR comment carrying a hidden body marker.
#
# Several CI scripts keep exactly ONE comment per concern on a PR and key it on a
# hidden HTML-comment marker, so a re-run edits that comment instead of stacking
# another. Finding it is the whole idempotence guarantee: a lookup that returns
# nothing does not degrade to "no comment", it degrades to "post another one",
# every run.
#
# The sibling lib-marker-issue.sh does this for open issues and PRs, which come
# from `gh issue list`. Comments come from a paginated REST collection instead,
# so the enumeration differs even though the discipline does not.
#
# Requires lib-ci-retry.sh to be sourced first (retry_stdout) and `jq` on PATH.

# The marker must be the body's FIRST bytes, so a match means the comment IS of
# this kind — not merely that it quotes the marker somewhere. post-merge-delta-review.sh
# is why: it splices a review block, opened by REVIEW_START, into the MIDDLE of the
# remerge-diff comment, then deletes standalone review stickies left by older
# runs. Under a `contains` predicate that cleanup also matches the comment it just
# folded the block into, and deletes it.
#
# The marker reaches jq through the environment, never spliced into the filter
# text. A marker holding a `"` would close the string and turn the rest into
# filter syntax.

#
# PROBLEM CLASS — a sticky comment DELETED between the run that listed it and the run
# that touches it. Every id here is read from a listing and used one round trip later,
# so a concurrent run that rewrites or deletes the sticky in that window makes the next
# call 404. The retry ladder cannot tell that from an outage: no amount of backoff turns
# a deleted comment into a body, so it spends five attempts and reports its own
# exhaustion code, and the caller dies with its report unpublished. Callers that have a
# second place to put the report branch on 2; the rest still die, one attempt sooner.
#
# The first attempt is therefore unretried, and only a NON-404 failure goes through the
# ladder, where a 5xx or a rate limit still gets the backoff it needs.

# patch_comment_if_changed ENDPOINT BODY_FILE [CURRENT_FILE] — write BODY_FILE into
# the comment at ENDPOINT, unless that comment already holds those bytes. Pass
# CURRENT_FILE when the caller has already read the present body, so the guard costs
# no second round trip.
#
# PROBLEM CLASS — a sticky comment rewritten with the body it already has. GitHub
# sends an `issue_comment: edited` webhook for a no-op PATCH, so every subscriber to
# the pull request wakes and re-reads a report that says what it said last time. A
# workflow that re-renders on each push then costs one wake per push and tells the
# reader nothing new.
#
# The comparison ignores only what the round trip itself adds: `gh api --jq .body`
# ends its output with a newline of its own, and a body a browser composed is stored
# with CRLF line endings. Command substitution drops the trailing newlines and `tr`
# drops the carriage returns. Every other difference is a real one and gets the
# PATCH. A read that FAILS gets the PATCH too — a stale report is the failure this
# must never cause, and one extra wake is the cheaper wrong answer.
#
# Returns 2 when the comment is gone, per gh_unless_gone above.
