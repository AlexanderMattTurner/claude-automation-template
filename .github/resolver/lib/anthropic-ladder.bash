# A rung is abandoned when the API's verdict is about the CREDENTIAL: an HTTP
# 401/403 outright, a 400 (Anthropic's status for a metered key over its own usage
# cap, indistinguishable by status or error type from a malformed request), or a
# 429 that survives the rung's own retries. A malformed request therefore also
# steps every rung before the ladder fails loud. Everything else keeps its meaning:
# 408/5xx and transport failures retry on the SAME credential, and exhausting the
# ladder fails loud. FAR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY sits FIRST: it is the org's own metered
# key, spent unconditionally before any subscription token. Those follow, with
# CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN — the maintainer's personal account — last.
#
# `.claude/dev-notes` § "Credential ladder for the Anthropic API
# (`.github/scripts/lib/anthropic-ladder.bash`)" carries the rest.

# The rung list and its order live in oauth-ladder.bash, which the conflict resolver and
# the pre-push self-review read too. A copy here is how a rung goes missing from one caller
# and not the others. OAUTH_LADDER_LIB points this at the BASE branch's copy for
# release-prep-bump-version.sh: that job holds a PAT, so it loads no file from the PR head.
