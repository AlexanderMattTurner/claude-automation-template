# decision off it; the owner and its readers must name the same string, or the
# reader silently stops seeing the label and the two tools act on the same PR.
# The strings live in shared-names.json, which auto-resolve/discover.py and the
# Python sweeps read too, so a rename reaches both languages at once.
