# kcov-exclude: a GitHub Actions step body that no test runs: it reads the runner's context
#   — GITHUB_*, a job-scoped GH_TOKEN, an actions/ working directory — or provisions the

# Contract: sourced into strict-mode (set -euo pipefail) callers; do not re-set shell options.
#
# PROBLEM CLASS — deciding WHICH credentials a run spends and in what order, in
# more than one language. Three callers each had their own copy of this loop, so
# a token that is expired, revoked or rate-limited could be skipped by one and
# spent by another. `oauth_ladder_names` is the only walk in the tree: the ORDER
# comes from `shared-names.json`, and `auto-resolve/bundle.py` runs this function
# rather than repeating it.
#
# It emits variable NAMES, never their values, so a caller in another language
# reads the credentials from its own environment and no token ever crosses a pipe
# into a capture buffer a traceback could print.
