# kcov-exclude: a GitHub Actions step body that no test runs: it reads the runner's context
#   — GITHUB_*, a job-scoped GH_TOKEN, an actions/ working directory — or provisions the

# Contract: sourced into strict-mode (set -euo pipefail) callers; do not re-set shell options.

# The auto-resolver's ONE-ATTEMPT-PER-HEAD mark, shared by the two sides that must agree on
# it: the resolve job marks the head commit it ran against, and discover skips any PR whose
# current head carries the mark. It stops a paid re-resolution of the tree that just failed.
#
# A commit STATUS rather than a label or a comment, because the fact recorded is a property
# of one tree and must be keyed by that tree's SHA. A label is PR-scoped and survives a
# branch move; pushing new commits clears a status by construction.
#
# The mark EXPIRES. It is written BEFORE the resolution runs, because the runs worth
# stopping are the ones that end badly and never reach a final step, so it cannot tell "this
# tree was resolved" from "the resolver was broken". discover.py therefore skips a head only
# while its newest mark is younger than AUTO_RESOLVE_ATTEMPT_TTL_HOURS — and, once the mark
# is AUTO_RESOLVE_ATTEMPT_FLOOR_HOURS old, only while the base has not moved since the mark
# was written. Spend per head stays capped at (commit-age window / floor) attempts while the
# base moves, (window / TTL) while it does not.
#
# A run RELEASES its own mark when it spent NOTHING. Prepare's no-op exits (the base is
# already in the head; the merge would fast-forward the PR away) mean this tree was never
# resolved, so an unreleased mark would suppress every scan for a full TTL. The outer bound
# is the commit-age window in discover.py: an untouched branch leaves the candidate set.

# This file is the WRITER half of the mark. The reader half — the freshness test
# and the AUTO_RESOLVE_ATTEMPT_TTL_HOURS knob it reads — lives in
# auto-resolve/discover.py, the only thing that ever consults a mark. Both halves
# read the context string out of shared-names.json, so neither can rename it
# alone: a reader querying a context nobody writes finds nothing and reports the
# head unmarked, which is the failure the mark exists to prevent.

# The HANDOFF mark, written when a paid run resolved what it could and left conflict
# markers for a human. discover holds this one with no floor and no TTL: the attempt
# mark expires because the failure it records may have been the resolver's own, while
# this one records the MODEL's verdict on this tree, which a re-run reproduces at full
# cost. A push to the head clears it, because the tree it judged is then gone.
AUTO_RESOLVE_HANDOFF_CONTEXT="$(shared_name .commit_status_marks.auto_resolve_handoff)"

# The DECLINE mark, written when the model read the conflict and left the markers on
# purpose. Split from the handoff mark because the two answer different questions: a
# handoff records that the HARNESS delivered nothing (a denied tool, a shard that wrote
# no file), which a resolver change plausibly repairs, so discover retires it on one. A
# decline records the MODEL's verdict on these hunks, which a resolver change does not
# alter — retiring the two together re-bought one PR's identical refusal three times in
# one day. Only a push to the head clears this one.
