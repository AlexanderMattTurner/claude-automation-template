# kcov-exclude: a GitHub Actions step body that no test runs: it reads the runner's context
#   — GITHUB_*, a job-scoped GH_TOKEN, an actions/ working directory — or provisions the

# Contract: sourced into strict-mode (set -euo pipefail) callers; do not re-set shell options.

# PROBLEM CLASS — a name two LANGUAGES must spell identically, and an ordered
# SET of names two languages must enumerate identically. A PR label bash applies
# and Python reads, a commit-status context bash posts and Python queries, the
# OAuth credential ladder bash walks and Python walks: a second spelling drifts
# silently, because a reader that matches nothing looks exactly like a PR nothing
# has marked, and a hand-typed copy of a SET drops a member invisibly — the
# omission shows only when the one credential an operator provisioned is the one
# that got skipped. `shared-names.json` beside this file is the one definition —
# `jq` reads it here, `json.load` reads it in `_pr_sweep.py`,
# auto-resolve/discover.py and auto-resolve/bundle.py — so a rename or a new
# member reaches both languages at once.

  # shared_name JQ-PATH — print the one spelling at PATH, as in
