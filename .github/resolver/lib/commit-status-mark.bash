# A per-head mark as a commit STATUS, shared by every sweep that must do a thing
# at most once per head per time window (the auto-resolver's attempt mark, the
# auto-merge re-arm latch). A status attaches to the commit, so pushing new
# commits clears it by construction — nothing to clean up; the TTL bounds
# retries against an UNCHANGED head, so a transient failure self-heals after
# the window instead of stranding the head forever.
#
# A mark can also be RELEASED before its TTL, for the case the TTL is too blunt
# for: the marked run turned out to do nothing at all, so it consumed a budget it
# never spent. The release is a status of its own on a `-released` context rather
# than a non-success state on the mark's context, because a red status on a PR
# head is not inert — GitHub reports the head UNSTABLE, which is the input the
# auto-merge and re-arm paths read.
