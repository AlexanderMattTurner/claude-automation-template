# kcov-exclude: a GitHub Actions step body no test runs — it reads runner-only context or provisions the runner itself.
# Contract: sourced into strict-mode (set -euo pipefail) callers; do not re-set shell options.
# The PR review-thread read, in ONE place: the GraphQL document plus the
# `gh api graphql --paginate` call that walks it. INVARIANT: every step that needs a PR's review threads goes through fetch_review_threads, so no caller can ship a `reviewThreads(first: 100)` with no cursor — a query that silently drops every thread past the first page and reports the truncated slice as the whole set. Callers differ only in the jq they project each page's nodes through.
#
# Consumers: review_findings_gate.py, prepare-merge-delta-input.sh, post-merge-delta-review.sh.
#
# API:
#   fetch_review_threads <owner> <name> <pr> <jq> [comments-per-thread] — walk EVERY page, applying <jq> to each page's nodes ARRAY. Non-zero once retries exhaust.
#   raise_human_review_finding <marker> <prose-file> — open ONE file-level finding thread stamped <marker>, unless an UNRESOLVED thread already carries it. Requires GH_REPO, PR, HEAD_SHA and an exported REVIEWER_LOGIN_BARE.
#   settled_merge_delta_shas <owner> <name> <pr> — every merge sha a merge-delta finding thread was raised about, replied to by a non-reviewer, and resolved.

# `$endCursor` and `pageInfo` are what let `gh api graphql --paginate` walk: drop either and gh has no cursor to advance, so it returns page one forever and reports a truncated thread set as the whole one. That set feeds the review-findings merge gate, so an under-read greens a gate that should be red.
