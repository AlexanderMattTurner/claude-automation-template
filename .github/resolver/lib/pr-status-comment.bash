# kcov-exclude: a GitHub Actions step body with a behavioral suite: the suite runs the
#   calling scripts under `bash` against a localhost GitHub, so the branches are asserted
#   but no run is ever traced.
# Contract: sourced into strict-mode (set -euo pipefail) callers; do not re-set shell
# options. Callers provide `retry`/`retry_stdout` (lib-ci-retry.sh).
#
# ONE auto-resolve comment per pull request, posted when a run TAKES a conflict on and
# REWRITTEN with the verdict when that run ends.
#
# PROBLEM CLASS — a long automated job whose progress is invisible on the artifact it
# works on. A resolver that comments only at the end is silent for its whole run and
# silent forever when it dies, so "a resolver is working on this", "a resolver gave up"
# and "no resolver ever looked" all read the same on the PR. The state therefore lives in
# the comment BODY, where the reader is already looking, and every later state rewrites
# that body instead of adding a comment under it.
#
# The lookup and the no-op-PATCH guard come from lib-marker-comment.sh, which every other
# sticky comment in this tree uses. What this file adds is the SECOND marker: a line that
# says the run is still in flight. It is what lets a job that ended badly claim the
# comment while a job that already published a verdict keeps it — the distinction an
# `always()` step cannot make from its own job status, because it also runs after the
# steps that succeeded.
