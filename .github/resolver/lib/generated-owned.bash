# kcov-exclude: library-only — sourced into prepare.sh, with no entry point of its own,

# PROBLEM CLASS — decoding `scripts/resolve-generated.mjs --owned` in more than one
# place. That command prints one generator-owned path per line, and a rule's
# `ownsPrefix` as a directory with a TRAILING SLASH — the form that covers a set the
# per-file enumeration cannot list (a dependency bump renames every vendored
# `dist-info` file). Two readers decoded it independently and disagreed about what
# they covered, which is the failure this file exists to make impossible: one reader
# honoured the prefix form and the other did not, so one of them silently answered
# "not owned" for a whole owned directory.
#
# Source this file, call gb_load_generated_owned once, then gb_is_generated_owned
# per path.

# The parsed answer. Exact paths in the map, directory prefixes in the list.
