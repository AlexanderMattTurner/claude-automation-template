"""The store behind METRICS.md's Claude-usage metric: one record per Claude run.

PROBLEM CLASS — measuring what the fleet spends on Claude. It cannot be read back
from the GitHub API: a workflow's run count overstates its invocations (an
umbrella workflow runs its Claude job under one `if:` of many, so `pr-meta` shows
13023 runs to about 2100 real ones), and the job-level truth costs one call per
run — about 1100 a day here. So the run RECORDS what it billed, and this module
is both ends of that record.

The path from a run to the chart, and why it bends where it does:

  * The run appends one line per attempt to `usage_file()` and publishes it as the
    artifact `claude-usage-<job>-<index>`, overwriting its own earlier upload, so
    one job leaves exactly one artifact carrying every attempt it made.
  * ARTIFACTS, not a direct write to the store, because two of the six Claude
    surfaces check out an untrusted PR head. Handing those jobs a bucket
    credential would put a write key inside a run that executes PR-authored
    content, to save a hop in a metric.
  * The daily chart cron — trusted, and already holding the bucket credentials —
    ingests those artifacts and writes `daily/<UTC date>.json` per completed day.
    Artifacts expire in two weeks; the daily objects are the history.

A run without R2 credentials still records: the artifact is written with the job's
own token. A day is compacted once, and only after it is complete — a total
published from a partial day reads as a real drop in spend.
