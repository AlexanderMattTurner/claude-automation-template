# kcov-exclude: a GitHub Actions step body that no test runs: it reads the runner's context
#   — GITHUB_*, a job-scoped GH_TOKEN, an actions/ working directory — or provisions the
#   runner itself, so it has no entry point off a runner.
# Stage an agent run's logs for upload, REDACTED — the body of the
# upload-agent-logs composite, extracted so shellcheck/shfmt see it.
#
# The contract this file exists to hold: the staging directory ends up holding
# either fully-masked logs or a placeholder saying why it does not. It never holds
# raw agent output.
#
# The two ways this ends in no logs are NOT interchangeable, and separating them is
# the second contract:
#   * the engine is not installed at all — a WIRING bug in the calling job, which
#     nobody will ever fix while it presents as a healthy run that merely published
#     nothing, so it fails the job;
#   * the engine is installed and refuses THIS input — a real redaction refusal.
#     Withholding the logs is the correct outcome, so the job keeps its own verdict
#     and only gets an annotation.
#
# Env:
#   LOGS_PATH  the log file or directory to publish; empty when the producing
#              step was skipped, which is not an error
#   LOGS_OUT   staging directory to fill (created by the caller)
#   REDACTOR   path to redact-agent-logs.py, on a TRUSTED ref
#   HOOKS_DIR  dir holding the redactor_config the engine is configured from
#   REPO_ROOT  checkout holding bin/lib/transcript-publish.py (the engine)
#   PYTHON     interpreter that can import the engine; defaults to REPO_ROOT's own
#              synced venv, falling back to python3. A caller whose WORKSPACE venv
#              is untrusted points this at a venv built from a trusted ref instead.
