# kcov-exclude: a GitHub Actions step body that no test runs: it reads the runner's context
#   — GITHUB_*, a job-scoped GH_TOKEN, an actions/ working directory — or provisions the
#   runner itself, so it has no entry point off a runner.
# Shared exponential-backoff retry for CI scripts — one source of truth so a flaky
# network step (a registry download or GitHub API 5xx blip) is re-tried the same
# way everywhere, while a genuine failure still exhausts the cap and goes red (fail loud).
#
# PROBLEM CLASS — a retry that cannot tell a blip from an answer. A linter,
# scanner or test runner reports what it FOUND through its exit code, so a
# blanket retry re-runs a verdict that cannot change and then reports this
# helper's own exhaustion code in place of it: a supply-chain finding arrives
# indistinguishable from an API outage. RETRY_EXIT_CODES is the one place that
# distinction is expressed, so no caller writes a second backoff loop to get it.
#
# Source it and call `retry <cmd> [args…]` — or `retry_stdout <cmd> [args…]` when
# capturing the output in a command substitution. Tune per call site with:
#   RETRY_MAX         attempts before giving up (default 5)
#   RETRY_BASE_DELAY  first backoff in seconds; doubles each attempt (default 2)
#   RETRY_EXIT_CODES  space-separated exit codes that are retryable; empty (the
#                     default) retries every nonzero exit. zizmor sets it to 1,
#                     its tool-error code, so its finding code 14 is reported
#                     once instead of re-run.
# It does NOT set shell options — the caller owns `set -e`/pipefail; each attempt runs
# in an `||` list so a failing attempt never trips the caller's `-e`.

# Guard against double-source (a script that sources this AND a lib that also does).
# This file is only ever sourced, so a top-level `return` is well-defined.
