"""Decide whether a merge-resolution hunk (`git show --remerge-diff`) carries anything genuinely new — not a parent's own edit, and not since undone.

PROBLEM CLASS — is a block of diff text still present in some other revision of the file? Counted not searched: a short line (`fi`, `}`) matches anywhere.

Weakening any predicate here fails this instrument OPEN, so four shapes are deliberate: `_line_runs` never joins a run across a conflict marker; `_count_block` counts and never tests membership; `_added_gone_at_head` demands ABSOLUTE absence per line; `hunk_traced_to_the_parents` compares directionally. `.claude/dev-notes` § "Merge-delta novelty judgements (`.github/resolver/_merge_delta_novelty.py`)" carries the reasoning.

    fewer times than the mechanical merge had it, so it stays a removal. The

    comparison would satisfy at zero.

    The HEAD conjunct is what stops this failing open. Judged against the merge

    it moved TO leave the reviewer told to raise no deletion finding on a line
    shipping nowhere — the `+` half retires as undone, the `-` half stays in the
    fence, and nothing names the loss. Presence is the exact question there, so
    this one conjunct is membership: one surviving occurrence is a line the merge
    did not delete, whatever a later commit did to a second copy. In `--commit`
    mode the head IS the merge, so the conjunct is free.

    POSITIONS not text, for the reason `corrected_positions` carries. A blank
