"""Print the pinned specs for the Python packages the auto-resolve job installs into
its ambient interpreter, one per line, read out of a pyproject.toml.

Two sets, because they sit in different tables and serve different steps (see
install-hook-tools.sh). Default: the distributions the `language: system` pre-commit
hooks import, from the dev extra. `--runtime`: the distributions the job's own
scripts import, from `[project].dependencies`.

They are named here by DISTRIBUTION name — `pyyaml` imports as `yaml` — while the
installer asserts the IMPORT names, so the two halves of the provisioning check each
other.

Reading the specs rather than restating them keeps pyproject.toml the one place these
versions live; a copy here would be a pin to keep in lockstep.
