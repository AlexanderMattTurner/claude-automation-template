"""The credential ladder's retry policy, as one function over recorded rung outcomes.

PROBLEM CLASS — a retry policy written as N copies of a workflow step states its rules
N times, so a rule that changes has N sites to change and a rung added later inherits
whichever copy was pasted. This module is those rules once, and
`auto-resolve/run-ladder.py` walks them in one loop over the rung table.

The five rules, each load-bearing:
  * A rung that did NOT error is the answer. A genuine "conflict too hard" run has
    is_error false and a real cost; retrying it spends again on the same wall.
  * Rung 2 alone may retry the SAME credential, and only on a proven zero_cost error —
    no inference was billed, so the retry is free whether the cause was a transient
    blip or a dead token.
  * Every later rung needs a DISTINCT configured credential. The free retry already
    happened at rung 2; a further same-token attempt only spends.
  * A ladder that billed nothing anywhere hands its attempt mark back. Reading only the
    last rung would release a mark on a run that DID spend at an earlier one.
  * A wall-clock-only failure never advances, at any rung. A fresh credential faces
    the identical wall, so a further attempt spends again with no new information.

Pure functions over already-read values, so the caller owns every read of the
environment. Standard library only: the resolve job checks `.github/scripts` out
sparsely and runs the system python3.
