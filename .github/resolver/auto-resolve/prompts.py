# How to read one conflict block, spelled once for both prompts below. It has to
# describe what prepare.sh actually writes: diff3, so every block carries a THIRD
# region that is the merge base. A shard told only about two sides either keeps
# the base text — resurrecting content a side deleted on purpose — or leaves the
# `|||||||` line behind, which every scan without the `|{7}` branch reads as a
# clean tree.
_CONFLICT_BLOCK_GUIDANCE = """- Read it. Each conflict block is `<<<<<<<` / `|||||||` / `=======` /
  `>>>>>>>`. The region between `|||||||` and `=======` is the merge BASE —
  the common ancestor of both sides, NOT a third side to keep. Use it to tell
  a line one side deliberately DELETED from a line the other side never had,
  then delete that region along with the markers.
- Understand BOTH sides' intent and produce the correct merged result
  that preserves both changes where they are compatible.
- A GENERATED region is the one thing you never merge. A comment saying
  the block below is generated, or a `GENERATED FILE` banner at the top of
  the file, means a tool prints those lines from a source elsewhere in the
  tree. Neither side's text is the answer there: the answer is whatever
  the tool prints from the MERGED source, which you have no shell to run.
  Keep the region's conflict markers in place and resolve the rest of the
  file. A human or a later step then regenerates it, where a merge of the
  two drawings lands bytes no tool produces and reads as reviewed prose."""
