# shellcheck shell=bash
# kcov-exclude: untraceable run: lib.test.mjs drives protected_matches via Node's execFileSync("bash", ["-c", 'source "${LIB}"; protected_matches "$@"', …]) — outside the Python kcov interceptor's reach (it only wraps Python's subprocess) and, even ignoring that, argv[1] is source text, so no invocation names the tracked path. The PREPARE, BUNDLE and LAND workflow steps that source the rest of it run only on a real conflicted PR.
# Shared by the auto-resolve PREPARE, BUNDLE and LAND steps (sourced, not run).

# Every helper's design rationale — the sensitive-path set and who re-derives
# it, why diff3 is load-bearing, the three structural_solve acceptance
# conditions, the harness refusal list and the run behind each member, the
# committed-marker scope rule, the silent revert is_modify_delete prevents, and
# why a fragment id collision splits — lives in
# `.claude/dev-notes` § "Auto-resolve shared shell library (`.github/scripts/auto-resolve/lib.sh`)".
#
# Three invariants bind every editor here:
#   * CONFLICT_MARKER_RE is the ONE spelling both these shell steps and
#     bundle.py grep with; a second copy drifts, and a Python step then finds
#     no markers on a merge the shell steps refuse.
#   * A marker verdict needs the COMPLETE triple. `=======` alone is legal
#     Markdown and ordinary banner art, so one kind would call prose damage.
#   * structural_solve accepts only exit 0 AND non-empty output AND no
#     `<<<<<<<`. mergiraf exits 0 printing nothing when it cannot solve, and
#     PREPARE copies this output over the file, so empty is silent data loss.

# * no `<<<<<<<` — a partial solve still carries markers, and the file must reach the LLM byte-identical to what git wrote when anything is left. `-p` prints and leaves FILE alone, which is what makes that last guarantee true. `--kill-after` makes the bound real: a parse ignoring SIGTERM would wait forever.
