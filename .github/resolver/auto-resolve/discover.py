"""Auto-resolve merge conflicts — DISCOVER step.

Emits the set of PRs the resolve job should process, as a compact JSON array of
``{number, head_ref, base_ref, head_sha}`` written to ``$GITHUB_OUTPUT`` as
``prs=...``.

Only PRs the resolver is allowed to touch are emitted: open, not a WIP draft,
same-repo head (a fork's token is read-only and its author is untrusted), not a
stacked child, and either CONFLICTING or holding a wedged merge-queue entry. A
dependency bot's PR the bot STILL MANAGES is excluded on its HEAD COMMIT's
author, not the PR's, because that upkeep ends when anyone else pushes.

Two filters bound the spend, both keyed to the PR's OWN activity rather than to
the clock: ``AUTO_RESOLVE_MAX_COMMIT_AGE_HOURS`` and a per-head attempt mark,
which a catch-up run drops with ``0`` and ``AUTO_RESOLVE_IGNORE_ATTEMPT_MARK``.
A third filter is correctness, not spend: a PR with a merge-queue entry the
queue could still build is never emitted, because a push would dequeue it.

This module imports the standard library and the shared scaffolding one
directory up — ``_ci_retry`` and ``_pr_sweep``. The discover job checks out
``.github/scripts`` sparsely and runs on the system ``python3``, so it can reach
nothing outside that tree and no virtual environment.

`.claude/dev-notes` § "Auto-resolve discover" carries each classifier's ordering; the
knobs this module reads are:

  * ``AUTO_RESOLVE_ATTEMPT_FLOOR_HOURS`` — once the mark is this old, a base push after it re-enables the PR.
  * ``AUTO_RESOLVE_ATTEMPT_TTL_HOURS`` — how long the mark holds while the base does not move.
  * ``MAX_PASSES`` — re-queries of a mergeability GitHub has not settled; skipped for a PR the queue has wedged, because GitHub stops recomputing once the queue owns its entry.

# The code a re-run executes, so a commit to any of it retires every mark older than

# the resolve workflow's own entry points, because a hand-typed list drifts silently
# in the direction that strands a pull request — the resolver is the only actor that
# pushes a conflicted head, so a path the list omits holds that head for good. Add a
# path no static read can reach (a `pnpm` alias, a prompt the model is pointed at)
# straight to the tuple: regeneration seeds from it and never prunes. A fix elsewhere
# retires nothing; land it with a touch here, or dispatch the workflow with
