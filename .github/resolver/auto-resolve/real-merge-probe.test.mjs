//
// What IS covered is that the probe reds rather than greens when it cannot look,
// or when the tool answers with something that is not a merge — a probe that
// passes in those states certifies nothing, one level up from the inert pre-pass
// it was written to catch. Each stub here induces a reply the real binary will
