#!/usr/bin/env bash
# kcov-exclude: a GitHub Actions step body with a behavioral suite: the suite runs the real
# script as `bash <script>` against stubbed CLIs on PATH, so the branches are asserted but no run is ever traced. Auto-resolve merge conflicts — LAND step (the credentialed half of finalize).
#
# Takes the merge commit the `resolve` job bundled, re-derives every property that makes it safe to push, and pushes it to the PR head branch.
#
# Separate job because `resolve` checks out the PR's own head and runs local composites, `pnpm resolve-generated`, and a model over the tree — any of which can append to $GITHUB_ENV/$GITHUB_PATH and affect every later step in the SAME job. So a push credential anywhere in `resolve` is reachable from the PR's own bytes; the org PATs live only here. Nothing in this job executes workspace content — the workspace is a checkout of the PR head only so git has objects and a worktree to push from.
#
# The artifact carries git objects and nothing else, since a manifest or protected-path claim would be an assertion by the untrusted job. This script instead replays the merge in a scratch worktree to derive the conflicted set independently, and reports that set rather than believing one.
#
# `.claude/dev-notes` § "Auto-resolve LAND: re-deriving what makes a resolution safe to push (`.github/scripts/auto-resolve/land.sh`)" carries the job-split threat model, the admitted-shape derivations, and the stand-down and race-retry reasoning.
