# kcov-exclude: a GitHub Actions step body that no test runs: it reads the runner's context
#   — GITHUB_*, a job-scoped GH_TOKEN, an actions/ working directory — or provisions the
#   runner itself, so it has no entry point off a runner.
# Auto-resolve merge conflicts — MARK-ATTEMPT step.
#
# Records, on the head commit this job checked out, that the resolver ran against
# it. discover skips the PR while its head is unchanged and the base has not moved
# since the mark's timestamp, so a scan cannot re-run a paid resolution against the
# pair of trees that just produced one.
#
# Runs FIRST, before the merge and before any model call, so the mark survives a crash,
# a cancelled run and a timeout — marking on success only would leave exactly the
# expensive failures unmarked and free to repeat.
#
# It marks `git rev-parse HEAD` rather than the SHA discover emitted: if the branch moved
# between the scan and this checkout, THIS is the tree the run resolves. That same SHA
# goes on `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` as `head_sha`, since deriving it later reads a moved worktree.
#
# The mark is also this job's CLAIM on the head, because two scans of different SCOPES
# share no concurrency group and select the same head seconds apart. It settles before
# any spend: a read stands the job down on an earlier cycle's mark, then the write's own
# id arbitrates the runs that raced past that read (commit_status_mark_owns_claim
# carries the invariant), and `already_claimed=true` gates the expensive steps.
# Env: GH_TOKEN, REPO. Optional: AUTO_RESOLVE_ATTEMPT_TTL_HOURS (default 2, the same
# window discover holds a mark for), AUTO_RESOLVE_IGNORE_ATTEMPT_MARK=true to spend
# anyway — the catch-up input, which exists to re-run heads a mark is holding.
