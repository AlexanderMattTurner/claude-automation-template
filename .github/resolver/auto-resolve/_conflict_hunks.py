"""PROBLEM CLASS — cutting a conflicted file into the independent regions git
marked, and putting a resolved region back without touching the rest.

A resolver that hands a model a whole conflicted file gets a whole file back,
and pays for that twice. It pays in wall clock: PR #3826's shard understood a
947-line file's conflicts in 92 seconds and then spent every remaining second
rewriting all 947 lines, so the per-shard timeout killed it mid-write. It pays
in trust: the merged file is the one channel that can introduce content present
in NEITHER parent, and a model rewriting lines nobody put in conflict can change
them with nothing to compare against.

Splitting the file removes both. Each region is resolved on its own, and `splice`
copies every line OUTSIDE the regions byte for byte, so an untouched line cannot
change however the model behaves.

The markers are line-oriented, so this is a line state machine rather than a
regex over the whole text. The pattern that opens and closes a region is the one
in .github/scripts/lib/shared-names.json, which bundle.py and lib.sh also read.
