"""Auto-resolve merge conflicts — the GENERATED-REGION pre-pass.

PROBLEM CLASS — a conflict inside a `BEGIN GENERATED`/`END GENERATED` region is
DERIVED content, so neither side of it was authored and neither side is the
answer. Handing one to the model pays for a judgement nobody has to make, and on
a region that is a single 4,000-character line the model does not make it: run
5503 spent $0.54 across two shards on `.github/workflows/bash-mutation.yaml`'s
`paths-regex` region, reported success, and left the markers standing.

The generator that owns a region is named on the region's own BEGIN line, so
this step carries no table of its own. For a file whose every hunk sits inside
such a region it takes OURS, runs the generators the regions name, and checks
the file came back marker-free. Taking a side is not a resolution — the
generator overwrites it on the next line — it only produces a file the
generator can parse.

A file with one hunk OUTSIDE any generated region is left whole to the LLM.
Resolving the rest would hand the model a file whose remaining markers no longer
match the ones its prompt describes.

Every failure here falls through to the LLM with a warning, which is what the
resolver did for these files before this step existed.
