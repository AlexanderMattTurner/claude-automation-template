# kcov-exclude: a GitHub Actions step body that no test runs: it reads the runner's context
#   — GITHUB_*, a job-scoped GH_TOKEN, an actions/ working directory — or provisions the
#   runner itself, so it has no entry point off a runner.
# Install what `pre-commit run --files` needs in order to actually RUN over a
# resolved conflict: the external hook binaries, and the Python packages the
# `language: system` python hooks import — both at the versions this repo pins.
#
# Load-bearing, not a convenience. A `language: system` hook runs against the AMBIENT
# interpreter and PATH, so pre-commit provisions nothing for it: a missing binary is
# reported as a hook failure, and a missing import aborts the hook with a
# ModuleNotFoundError. Either way the resolver reads a red and refuses the resolution with
# "the resolved content fails the repo's pre-commit hooks", blaming the merge for a
# provisioning fault, on a job that deliberately skips `uv sync` so a pull request cannot
# choose what a write-token job installs. Only hard-failing hooks are covered;
# scripts/shellharden-run.sh and scripts/gitleaks-staged.sh skip themselves loudly, so a
# missing shellharden or gitleaks cannot abort a resolution.
#
# THE PINS COME FROM THE TRUSTED BASE REF, never from the checked-out PR head: this
# job carries a write token, and a PR that edited .github/tool-versions.sh or
# pyproject.toml would otherwise choose the version and download source of something
# this job installs and then executes. This script is itself staged out of the
# base-ref worktree, so the siblings it resolves relative to its own location are the
# base ref's copies — the same trust boundary the resolver's other scripts run behind.
