"""Resolve a merge conflict BLOCK-BY-BLOCK with concurrent, individually bounded
`claude` runs, then fold the per-shard execution logs into ONE aggregate log
carrying claude-code-action's result shape (so claude-run-errored.sh and
.github/scripts/checks/claude-execution.py read it unchanged).

Why not one prompt over the whole conflict set: a serial run's wall clock is the
SUM of per-file resolutions, and a concurrent push to the externally-writable PR
branch can throw a slow paid resolution away. Fanning out bounds the window by
the SLOWEST file.

Why the block and not the file: a shard given a whole file gives a whole file
back, spending its budget rewriting lines neither side put in conflict, with
nothing to compare them against. `_conflict_hunks` cuts the file into git's own
blocks and splices the answers back, so untouched lines are copied rather than
regenerated. A path with no blocks to cut — a modify/delete conflict, markers
that do not parse — keeps its single whole-file shard.

Security posture, per-shard: `--permission-mode acceptEdits`, the bounded tool set,
`--setting-sources user` (which stops untrusted `settings.json` loading, not project
memory or agent/MCP discovery from the same directory — the tool set plus finalize's
out-of-set edit guard hold the agent), a prompt scoped to ONE file, and the actor gate.

Env:
  CONFLICT_LIST            whitespace-separated conflicted paths (required)
  MODIFY_DELETE_PATHS      CONFLICT_LIST subset git left marker-free (one
                           side deleted); gets keep-or-delete, needs a verdict
  SIDECAR_PATHS            CONFLICT_LIST subset refused in-place edits;
                           gets a scratch path outside the repo
  PR_NUMBER                PR whose merge is being resolved (required)
  CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN  Claude Code OAuth token; ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (a
                           metered key) may fill this instead — one is required
  TRIGGERING_ACTOR         the run's initiating actor (required)
  GH_TOKEN, GH_REPO        read by the actor gate's permission probe
  MAX_PARALLEL             concurrent shards (default 4)
  SHARD_TIMEOUT_SECONDS    per-shard wall-clock bound, seconds, > 0 (default 600)
  FANOUT_BUDGET_SECONDS    wall clock the whole fan-out may spend across every
                           shard, seconds, > 0 (default 1200)
  FANOUT_DEADLINE_EPOCH    seconds since the epoch by which every fan-out of a
                           credential ladder must be done; caps the budget
                           above so the rungs share one window (optional)
  FANOUT_DIR               per-shard + aggregate log dir (default
                           "${RUNNER_TEMP:-/tmp}/conflict-fanout")
  PROVISIONAL_ATTEMPT      true when the caller owns the terminal verdict;
