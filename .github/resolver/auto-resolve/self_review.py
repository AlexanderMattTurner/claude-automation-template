"""Auto-resolve — SELF-REVIEW step.

Review the merge commit this job just built the way the post-push merge-delta
watchdog would, and let a model CORRECT what it flags, before the resolution is
pushed.

Rounds are bounded (MERGE_DELTA_MAX_ROUNDS, default 1). A resolution still flagged
after the last round is NOT pushed: this script exits non-zero and finalize hands the
conflict to a human.

Env: BASE_WORKTREE (the trusted base-ref worktree — prompts and the CLI installer are
read from there, never from the PR head), CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN (or, for the
ladder's metered last rung, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY). Optional: MERGE_DELTA_MAX_ROUNDS,
SELF_REVIEW_TIMEOUT_SECONDS, SELF_REVIEW_DIR, SELF_REVIEW_TOKEN_LADDER (ordered
credentials, one per line).

`--repo` is the workspace holding the merge, defaulting to the current directory.

Standard library only: the resolve job checks `.github/scripts` out sparsely and runs
the runner's own python3, before any project install.

`.claude/dev-notes` § "Auto-resolve self-review: reviewing a merge before it is pushed
(`.github/scripts/auto-resolve/self_review.py`)" carries the rest.
