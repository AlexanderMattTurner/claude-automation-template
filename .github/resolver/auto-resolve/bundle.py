"""Auto-resolve merge conflicts — BUNDLE step (the untrusted half of finalize).

Verifies the working tree is fully resolved (no unmerged paths, no stray conflict
markers, no edit outside the conflicted set), completes the merge commit LOCALLY,
and writes it to $BUNDLE_DIR as a git bundle for the separate `land` job.

It pushes nothing and holds no push credential: its commit is UNTRUSTED OUTPUT
that auto-resolve/land.sh re-derives every property of from git. It fails LOUD

        MORE cautious (disable auto-merge, say so on the PR), so forging it costs a
        run nothing and suppressing it lands a resolution the post-push reviewer
        still gates. Nothing `land` does on the push path reads it. `rung` is the
        same shape: RESOLVED_RUNG_LABEL comes from the trusted workflow's own
        `||` walk over step outputs, never from repo content, and `land` re-checks
        it against the fixed `1`-`7`/`api` set before quoting it — so this file
        can carry an outright-wrong label and nothing else, whatever wrote it.
        Written unconditionally so a stale copy from an earlier step in the same
        job can never survive into the artifact."""
