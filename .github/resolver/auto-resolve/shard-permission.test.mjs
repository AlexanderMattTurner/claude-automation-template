// shard-permission.mjs — the per-shard write grant. It is a pure path judge: it
// knows nothing about which paths Claude Code treats as sensitive, only which one
// path this shard was launched to deliver. Both directions fail silently on their
// own — without the ALLOW the shard cannot write its deliverable at all, and
// without the DENY it can clobber the file a concurrent shard is resolving, which
// only bundle.py's out-of-set guard would catch afterwards. Which path fanout.py
// puts in the grant (in-place file, sidecar scratch path, verdict) is the fanout
// wiring tests' subject, not this file's.
