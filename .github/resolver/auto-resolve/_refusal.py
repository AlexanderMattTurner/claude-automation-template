"""How the auto-resolve BUNDLE step gives up and tells a human.

Every check in bundle.py ends here when it refuses: the head is marked handed off,
the tree goes back, the pull request gets a comment naming the cause, and the step
exits non-zero so nothing is bundled. The mark is what stops the resolver paying for
the identical wall on every later base push; a PERMANENT refusal also labels the
pull request, which drops it from every later scan whatever its head does.
