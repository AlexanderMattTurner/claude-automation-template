# Auto-resolve merge conflicts — PREPARE step. Merges the PR base into the checked-out
# head, runs deterministic pre-passes (resolve-generated, the changelog fragment-id split,
# the generated-region re-derivation, then a mergiraf structural merge), then partitions
# what remains so the LLM sees only hand-mergeable text conflicts.
#
# "Conflicted" also covers committed conflict markers git does not report
# (committed_marker_paths in lib.sh).
#
# Outputs: conflict_list (text conflicts for the LLM); deferred_regen
# (rule-owned outputs whose source also conflicted, re-derived after the LLM);
# unresolvable (binary, or a `-merge` file owned by no rule — human only);
# sidecar (conflicts the resolver can read but not write, resolved to a
# scratch file bundle installs); modify_delete (one side deleted the path,
# LLM gives a keep-or-delete verdict); needs_llm/needs_commit; no_op_head (the
# attempt mark this run gives back, no-op exits only).
#
# A protected-path conflict still goes to the LLM; land flags it for human review. The
# checkout runs persist-credentials: false, so git authenticates via an HTTP extraheader.
#
# `.claude/dev-notes` § "Auto-resolve PREPARE: conflict partition and pre-passes" carries
