"""The scaffolding every open-PR sweep needs.

One capped listing of a repository's open PRs, the shared retry around every
``gh`` call, and the build verdict on a head. Sweep scripts import it by bare
name and run on system ``python3`` under a sparse checkout, so this imports only
what that checkout carries: the standard library, ``auto-resolve/_ci_retry`` and
``repolint._root``. That checkout is ``.github/scripts``, the root markers
``pyproject.toml`` and ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` that ``repo_root`` walks for,
and ``config/merge-queue-mode.json`` for :func:`committed_queue_mode`.
``rearm-auto-merge.yaml``'s sparse-checkout list is the live copy.

Three feature seams sit in their own modules, which import this one:
``_pr_marks`` holds the per-head commit-status latch, ``_pr_consent`` holds the
standing consent read and the mutations that act on it, and ``_pr_queue`` holds
the merge-queue vocabulary.

PROBLEM CLASS — two sweeps asking GitHub the same question. The ``--json``
field set is a parameter; the rest of the listing lives here once.
``lib/pr-sweep.bash`` answers the same question for the bash sweeps.

Design rationale for the retry policy, the strict timestamp parse, the log buffering and
the doubt-carrying return values: `.claude/dev-notes` § "Open-PR sweep scaffolding
(`.github/scripts/_pr_sweep.py`)".
