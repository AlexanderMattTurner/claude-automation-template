"""Upsert a marked region into a GitHub issue or PR body.

PROBLEM CLASS — a block appended to a body that already holds the previous run's
copy, so re-running a workflow stacks duplicates in the description. The body is
the surface a reviewer reads first, and nothing prunes it: every later run adds
another copy. Callers that write a repeated block into a body call `upsert` with
their own marker pair instead of appending; the pair is what makes the next run a
replacement rather than an addition.

Markers are HTML comments, so they are invisible in the rendered body — and they
are what an editor rewriting a body from a sanitized read silently drops, which is
why `sweep` exists (see `line-breakdown.py`).

As a CLI, for shell callers:

    body_region.py BODY_FILE SECTION_FILE OPEN_MARKER CLOSE_MARKER

writes the new body to stdout. SECTION_FILE need not carry the open marker; one is
added when absent, so a caller writes only the block it owns.
