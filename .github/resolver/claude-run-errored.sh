# kcov-exclude: a GitHub Actions step body with a behavioral suite: the suite runs the real
#   script as `bash <script>` against stubbed CLIs on PATH, so the branches are asserted but
#   no run is ever traced.
# Decide whether a claude-code-action attempt failed hard enough to retry on the
# fallback credential. claude-code-action exits 0 even on an is_error run, so the
# step `outcome` cannot distinguish a dead/expired token from a real result — the
# execution log is the only signal. errored=true on a missing/empty log (a crash)
# OR is_error true; a genuine "nothing to do" run has is_error false and is NOT
# retried. This is the retry DECISION, not the gate: it never fails the step
# (checks/claude-execution.py is the hard gate on the final attempt).
#
# Also emits zero_cost=true when the run billed nothing (total_cost_usd == 0, or a
# missing/empty log where no inference ran): a PROVEN zero-billed failure the
# caller may retry for free on the SAME credential (the auto-resolver's same-token
# retry). A genuine run that tried and failed on the work itself carries a cost, so
# zero_cost=false there and the caller does not burn a paid retry. Callers that
# only need the retry decision read errored and ignore zero_cost.
#
# Also emits wall_clock_only=true when the aggregate log says every errored shard
# died at the wall-clock timeout (auto-resolve/fanout.py's `wall_clock_only`): a
# fresh credential faces the identical wall, so the auto-resolver's ladder stops.
# Defaults false — only the fan-out aggregate this ladder reads ever sets it true.
#
# It also BILLS the log to METRICS.md's Claude-usage ledger. This decider follows every
# resolver rung, so billing here measures every Claude surface with no per-workflow wiring.
